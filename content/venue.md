## Accomodation

Accommodation is not arranged by the conference organizers. Each participant is invited to do their booking individually at one of the many downtown hotels of Rennes. For your accommodation, you may book a hotel in the southern or northern city center, as you will never be far from a metro stop or a bus stop.

The city of Rennes is well served by public transport with its 2 metros and numerous bus lines making Beaulieu campus accessible in 10 minutes with the new metro line (B) and up to 20-25 minutes by bus. Suggested itineraries to reach Beaulieu campus from the city center are detailed on the Venue page. A list of accommodation options is available at the [Tourist Office Site of Rennes](https://www.tourisme-rennes.com/en/).

## Inria Conference center

### Location and reaching the center 

The Beaulieu university campus. This is the main scientific campus in Rennes, which is located just outside of the city center. It is very easily reachable by bus (10-15 minutes ride from the city center), and it provides excellent infrastructure for both the workshops and the main conference at only symbolic cost (or even possibly entirely free).
Specifically:
 * From the train station, take metro B or metro A + bus C4/C6  (stop: Tournebride)
 * From the airport, take bus C6.
"RÃ©publique" station is the central place where C4/C6 are highly available.
Besides, there are plenty of cabs at the station and airport.
