### Variability in brain imaging studies across different analysis pipelines by [Camille Maumet](http://camillemaumet.com/) 


When a change in analysis methods leads to different results, what does it mean for our research findings?

In this presentation, I will discuss reproducibility in the field of brain imaging (also known as neuroimaging). Neuroimaging studies are characterized by a very large analysis space, and practitioners usually have to choose between different software, software versions, algorithms, parameters, etc.

For many years, these choices have been regarded as implementation details, but it is becoming increasingly clear that the exact choices of analytical strategy can lead to different and sometimes contradictory results. 

I will review our recent efforts to better understand and manage the different sources of this analytical variability.
