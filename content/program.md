VaMoS 2025 will have two exciting keynotes, an awards' session, and numerous talks for technical papers, tool demonstration, experience reports, and new and controversial ideas... and of course french-style social events in the beautiful city of Rennes as well as in the large Inria/IRISA research center. 

VaMoS will start February 3 with [MODEVAR](https://modevar.github.io/) and the conference per se will held February 4, February 5, and February 6.

## Keynotes

### Variability in brain imaging studies across different analysis pipelines by [Camille Maumet](http://camillemaumet.com/) (Inria) 

*February 4*

> When a change in analysis methods leads to different results, what does it mean for our research findings?
> In this presentation, I will discuss reproducibility in the field of brain imaging (also known as neuroimaging). Neuroimaging studies are characterized by a very large analysis space, and practitioners usually have to choose between different software, software versions, algorithms, parameters, etc.
> For many years, these choices have been regarded as implementation details, but it is becoming increasingly clear that the exact choices of analytical strategy can lead to different and sometimes contradictory results. 
> I will review our recent efforts to better understand and manage the different sources of this analytical variability.

Camille Maumet is a research scientist in neuroinformatics at the [Empenn team](https://team.inria.fr/empenn/), Inria Rennes Bretagne Atlantique / IRISA.
She studies neuroimaging reproducibility. Her current research focuses on the variability of analytical pipelines and its impact on our ability to reuse (and use) brain imaging datasets. She is also an open science advocate and participates actively in international communities including Brainhack, the INCF, and OHBM Open Science SIG.

### Model-Based PLE and Variability Modeling - Which is Yin and which is Yang? by Hugo Guillermo Chale-Gongora (Airbus)

*February 5* 

> Variability management and modelling (VM) undoubtedly plays a central role in feature-based and model-based product line engineering (MBPLE).
> VM alone, however, is far from guaranteeing an effective deployment of a product line approach in large organizations.
> This presentation will dig into the (long) journey undergone by many organizations when trying to implement product line engineering, and propose a return of experience about the right questions to ask regarding variability management and modelling.
> From this, a holistic approach to MBPLE that "aligns all the stars" (marketing, business analysis, architecting, design and engineering) will be proposed. 

Hugo Guillermo Chale-Gongora is the Head of PLE & Multidisciplinary Analysis and Optimisation at Airbus.
